I am building a futuristic GenAI Validator platform using Streamlit, but the current implementation has serious design flaws and is not visually appealing or professional. I want you to take the **existing Streamlit app (currently in app_futuristic.py)** and update it with the following design and UI/UX improvements:

---

🎬 LOGIN PAGE — Fullscreen Video & Futuristic Form
- Make the background video **play fullscreen**, autoplaying, muted, looped, **with no controls**.
- Overlay a **glassmorphism login form in the center** of the screen.
- Login card must contain:
  - Futuristic font (Orbitron, Poppins, Inter)
  - Username, Email, Role (dropdown), and a glowing "Login" button
- Apply a **dark overlay** or **blur effect** over the video so form fields stand out.
- Animate the login form (fade-in, slide-in).
- Remove any whitespace borders; the video should fully cover the screen.

---

🎨 GLOBAL THEME & BACKGROUND
- Convert the whole app into a **dark theme**:
  - Use a dark grey/blue gradient background (`#0F111A`, `#1C1E29`, `#242631`)
  - Light neon blue and green for buttons & active tabs
  - White/gray text (`#F0F0F0`) on dark background
- No white/bright backgrounds anywhere (dashboard, setup, metrics pages must all follow dark mode).
- Add a central `style.css` file to apply:
  - Custom fonts (Orbitron, Inter)
  - Scrollbar styling
  - Input hover transitions
  - Glass-style cards and glowing buttons

---

📦 DASHBOARD LAYOUT (Fixes & Restoration)
- Bring back the **Settings** tab in the left sidebar (it was removed in app_futuristic.py but existed in app_modern.py).
- Sidebar should:
  - Use modern glowing icons (Lucide, Feather, FontAwesome)
  - Highlight active tabs with smooth transition/glow
  - Avatar icon in top-right (or top of sidebar) with dropdown: Profile, Settings, Logout
- All pages (Dataset, Evaluation, Results) must use the **same dark background** and consistent spacing.

---

📑 EVALUATION FOCUS AREAS & METRICS — Visual Overhaul
- Remove all unnecessary icons (e.g., 🎯, 🚀, 🧠) next to labels like “Text Generation” and “Accuracy”.
- Redesign **Focus Area** and **Metric pills**:
  - Use beautiful pill buttons (soft border, glowing border on active)
  - Font should be clean and bold
  - Blue active state with smooth transitions (hover, click)
- Fix the issue where raw HTML code (`<span class="...">`) is being shown on screen — this is likely due to unescaped HTML in `st.markdown()`. Either:
  - Render it properly via `st.markdown(..., unsafe_allow_html=True)`
  - OR rewrite the UI using native Streamlit elements (buttons, checkboxes, columns)

---

📁 USE CASE / METRIC SELECTION — Refined Styling
- Use Case dropdown ("Text Generation" etc.) must be restyled:
  - Increase padding and font size
  - Add hover effect
  - Use capitalized styling or icons with label (optional)
- Ensure use case section blends well into the page (not floating white cards or unstyled blocks)

---

📊 RESULTS & ANALYSIS PAGE — Match Style + Function
- Results page should:
  - Use consistent dark styling with soft card containers
  - Only show results for **selected metrics**, organized per sample
  - Use color-coded badges for score ranges (High, Medium, Low)
  - Include expandable rows if more metric scores exist

---

🛠 CSS & STYLING SYSTEM
- Create or update `styles.css` with:
  - Custom fonts: Orbitron / Inter / Poppins
  - Full dark theme override
  - Glowing input borders
  - Glassmorphism panels
  - Video background styles
  - Card hover/transition animations
  - Remove white boxy elements completely

---

📌 MISC FIXES
- Fix broken HTML display caused by unrendered raw code (`<span class="...">`)
- Ensure no raw JS or HTML shows up in the UI
- All font colors should be high-contrast for dark mode

---

✅ FINAL INSTRUCTION

Update the **current Streamlit app (app_futuristic.py)** to meet all of the above requirements and restore any removed components like **Settings** tab. The final output must look futuristic, modern, clean, and usable as a commercial product. No placeholder-level visuals — everything must feel elegant, stylish, and polished.
