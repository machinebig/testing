I am building a GenAI Validator platform using Streamlit, and the current UI looks too basic and unfinished — like a college project. I want you to **refactor the entire frontend design** into something futuristic, stylish, elegant, and visually striking, similar to top-grade tools like UpTrain, LangSmith, PromptLayer, etc.

Here are the **exact updates to apply** to the existing code:

---

🎬 LOGIN PAGE (Modern Cinematic Design)
- Use a **full-screen background video** (muted, autoplay, no controls, looped).
- Overlay a **glassmorphism-style login card** in the center.
- The login card should have:
  - Bold, futuristic font (e.g., "Orbitron", "Poppins", or "Inter")
  - Text inputs for Username, Email, and Role (Dropdown)
  - Glowing login button with hover effect
- Add subtle **animation on login load** (e.g., fade-in, slide).
- Background should have a dark overlay gradient so the login form stands out.

---

🎨 GLOBAL THEME (Dark Mode First, Futuristic)
- Enable or set a **dark theme** as default using custom CSS.
- Use modern fonts like:
  - `Poppins`, `Inter`, `Orbitron`, `Satoshi`, or `Urbanist`
- Apply **glass-like effect** to all cards, side panels, and metric panels using semi-transparent backgrounds with blur.
- Buttons should have:
  - Hover transitions
  - Neon glow or soft shadows
  - Rounded corners and icon support

📑 PAGES & SECTIONS

1. **Sidebar Navigation:**
   - Icons + minimal labels
   - Glowing active state
   - Smooth hover transition
   - Profile avatar on top-right (after login)

2. **Evaluation Setup Page:**
   - Group metrics by Evaluation Focus with **pill-style toggle buttons**
   - Each metric toggle should animate on click (slide, glow, pop-in)
   - Add section separation lines with floating labels (like “Accuracy Metrics”, “Toxicity Metrics”)

3. **Dataset Upload:**
   - File uploader with large icon, drag-and-drop zone, and animated preview
   - Display accepted columns dynamically (e.g., "Expected: ground_truth or actual")

4. **Evaluation Result Page:**
   - Stylish per-sample table with alternating row colors, floating headers
   - Expandable rows to see more metrics if needed
   - Use badges like:
     - 🟢 High, 🟡 Medium, 🔴 Low OR visually elegant tags instead
   - Remove any outdated or stock-looking icons
   - Use glowing score boxes, animated percentage bars for score progress

5. **Graphs and Charts:**
   - Move charts to a separate “Visualize” tab
   - Use **Plotly with dark theme**
   - Make radar/bar charts 3D-style or minimal-flat modern (no old-fashioned bars)

---

🔧 CSS & Animation
- Add custom CSS with:
  - Font imports
  - Scrollbar styling
  - Button hover/active effects
  - Component animation (hover/slide/glow)
- Apply **smooth transitions** across all interactions (0.3s–0.5s)
- Use consistent spacing and alignment across all layouts

---

🗂 Folder Suggestions (if modular)
- `components/` → UI parts like Sidebar, LoginCard, MetricSelector
- `assets/` → Fonts, videos, logos
- `styles.css` → Central dark theme styles and animations

✅ FINAL INSTRUCTION

Update the current Streamlit app’s UI/UX **entirely** using the above specifications to make it look like a **futuristic, product-grade, GenAI evaluation platform** — sleek, elegant, dark-themed, and visually stunning.
