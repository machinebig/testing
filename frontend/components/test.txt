I have an existing Streamlit-based GenAI Validator platform. Its core functionality works, but the UI looks dated, unprofessional, and incomplete—more like a college project than a polished product t.he design and UI feel unfinished, not stylish or client-ready. I want you to transform the app/platform and update the existing `styles.css` file to achieve a **futuristic, elegant, client-sellable SaaS-grade design**.

Use the following instructions to update the UI across all key screens:

---

🎨 GLOBAL THEME — DARK, MODERN, CONSISTENT
- Apply a **cohesive dark grey theme** with base colors like `#1F3B4D`, `#29465B`, or `#154672`.
- Use high-contrast text: `#F0F0F0`.
- Use typography:
  - `'Orbitron'` for headings
  - ``'Poppins'` or Roboto Slab for body text
- Remove any light backgrounds and washed-out UI elements.
- In your **existing `styles.css`**, include:
  - Neon/glow button styles
  - Card hover/lift animations
  - Hover effects for tiles, buttons
  - Styled metric pills
  - Status badge styles (for system tiles and dashboards)
  - Smooth transitions for components
  - Sidebar + input styling in dark theme

---

📸 LOGIN PAGE (Access Portal—with Background Image)
- Use the current **background image** (already set).
- Overlay a **glassmorphism-style login card**, centered.
- Ensure login form uses:
  - Custom fonts
  - Glow-highlighted fields and button
  - "Access Platform" button styled with a modern gradient
- Animate on load (fade or slide) for smooth entry.
- Animate the card with a soft fade-in.
- Ensure fonts, spacing, and borders look clean on dark image background.

---

📊 DASHBOARD (Platform Overview)
- Switch to dark backdrops (`1E3E62` or tinted dark gray).
- Create clean **dashboard cards** for:
  - Total Evaluations
  - Active Datasets
  - Average Performance
- Each card should:
  - Feature a glowing icon (avoid emojis or default icons)
  - Show a large number in contrasting text
  - Include subtitle text like “+X this week”
- Use professional icons instead of emojis, from icon sets like Lucide, Phosphor, or Feather.

---

⚡ SYSTEM STATUS & QUICK STATS
- Transform tiles for API Server, DB, Queue, etc., into consistent glowing boxes:
  - Status badges: e.g. “🟢 Ready” (green), “🟡 Queued” (yellow), “🔴 Down” (red)
  - Use styled stats: “85 % Used” with color-coded progress bars
- Organize Quick Stats and Recent Activity visually using grid layout and glass cards.

---

🧠 EVALUATION FOCUS & METRICS SELECTOR
- Convert current metric options into **rounded, glowing pills**:
  - Active pill: bright fill (blue or teal), white text
  - Hover/active animations for UI feedback
- Make Use Case and Focus Area labels bold and readable—no small or washed-out fonts.
- Remove emoji or default icons; use minimal flat-design icons or just strong typographic pills.

---

🛠 TYPOGRAPHY & READABILITY ENHANCEMENTS
- Fix faded headings like “Platform Overview”, “Quick Stats”, etc., ensuring:
  - H1 (xxx): 32px, Orbitron, bold
  - Section headings: 24px, Semibold Inter or Poppins
  - Body text: 16px Inter or Poppins
- Ensure visible contrast on all backgrounds, with consistent spacing and padding.

---

📑 UPDATE EXISTING `styles.css`
Modify the existing file to include:
- Google Fonts imports (Orbitron + Inter/Poppins/Roboto Slab)
- Body and background colors for dark theme
- Glass card container styles with blur and glow
- Hovered button styles and pill-class styles
- Status badge styling
-  `.status-badge` class for API/Queue/DB status labels
- Input field theming, sidebar theming, and table styling
- Modern scrollbar and input field restyling


---

✅ FINAL INSTRUCTION
Update the current application code and `styles.css` file—**do not create a new one**—to implement all visual improvements above. The UI must now appear like a **client-ready, polished GenAI platform**, with consistent dark theme, readable typography, glowing accents, animated transitions, and professional layout across all pages.
